# Numerical Implementation of Differential Equations

As part of my undergraduate studies at the University of Basel, I undertook a project (1 ECTS) in 2019 with the objective of acquiring proficiency in MATLAB-based implementation of differential equations. The sole purpose of this repository is to serve as an archive for the project. It is important to mention that the project is conducted in the German language.

The project is divided into three distinct sections: Part I, Part II, and Part III, with each section having a corresponding "main"-MATLAB file.

The file [presentation.pdf](https://github.com/sabrimeyer/numerical-de/blob/main/documentation/presentation.pdf) was used to present and discuss the results of the project. Complementary to the presentation, the file [documentation.pdf](https://github.com/sabrimeyer/numerical-de/blob/main/documentation/documentation.pdf) written in LaTeX is included.
